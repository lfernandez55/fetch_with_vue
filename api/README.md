Backend derived from:
3200_flask_books_login_accesscontrol_all_sqlalchemy

# 3200_flask_basic_user_books_with_login_accesscontrol

This app builds on top of https://flask-user.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_app.html 
to create the Books site with login and rudimentary access control.  Per the basic app 
you have to install Babel, Flask-User and SQLAlchemy. Unlike the git repo flask_book_plus_auth 
it just uses SQLAlchemy.  No need for the older connectors we used from Pluralsight.  However, 
the addbook feature is still missing as is the categories link.
