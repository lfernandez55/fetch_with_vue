In your first terminal, `cd` into the "api" folder. Use `flask run` to start your Flask api in development server on localhost:5000.

In your second terminal, `cd` into the "webapp" folder. Install your node dependencies with `npm install`. Run the development version of the Vue webapp with `npm run serve`. The webapp will be running on localhost:8080.

---------------

The contents in API were created using standard Flask dev processes. See the readme for the derivative projects.

The initial contents inside webapp were created by opening a terminal at root (where this readme is located) and typing vue create webapp
